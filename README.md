# Smart Plants

This project aims at creating a platform in which users can install a small packet of sensors, specifically temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light intensity, close to their plants, and monitor their state by reading the values of the sensor from the application, as well as taking pictures of the plants, score them based on their health, and giving them small key words or phrases.
